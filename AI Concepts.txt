Simulation AI Concepts
----------------------



Memory:
	Entities should keep a mental map of things as they go out of range of vision (where things were last seen)
	1. If the entity returns to an area and the thing it remembers isn't  there anymore, remove it from memory



Alone:
	If the entity doesn't see anything else:
	1. return to a location where it remembers seeing a prey
	2. sweep the area for prey <- this might be hard to code - how do I store which regions of the map have been looked at?
		- divide map into pixel chunks
		- store an array of which chunks are "seen"
		- chunk "seen" score decays over time - return to chunk with the oldest "seen" score


Communication:
	If two objects on the same team are next to each other, they can see the objects the other sees



Spreading:
	Objects of the same type should try to space out in case one of them gets corrupted by a predator



Trapping:
	Objects hunting prey should move in a formation making it harder for the prey to escape



Tactical Releasing:
	Objects fleeing from predators should leave prey alive so it can kill the predator



Escape:
	Objects fleeing from predators should avoid being cornered in one of the simulation corners



Danger Rating:
	Predators have a "danger rating" based on their distance from the object, and if they are moving in the direction of the object
